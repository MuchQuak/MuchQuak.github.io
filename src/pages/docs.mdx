<h1 class="text-2xl pb-3">Ways to Create Lists</h1>
<h1 class="text-2xl pb-3">Editing a List</h1>
To edit the details of a list, one should click onto the list that they wish to
edit. Upon doing so, they will notice an edit icon under their name, which is
under the list name, and next to the share button. There is also a public toggle
button users can click to make their list either public or private. Below is an
image that has the location of the edit button and the public toggle circled in
blue, for those who have trouble trying to find these buttons.
<div class="flex justify-center">

    alt="editLocation.png"
    style="width:80%;height:80%;border:2px solid grey"
  />
</div>
Upon clicking the edit icon, a modal popup will be brought up which will allow
the user to edit their list name, description, type of list, region their list
applies to, and keyword tags. Once user is done with their modifications, they
just need to simply click the submit button to update their changes. Another
image is uploaded down below to show users what to expect upon clicking the edit
button. This popup modal is where users can make their changes.
<div class="flex justify-center">
  <img
    src="https://muchquak.github.io/editModal.png"
    alt="editModal.png"
    style="width:300px;height:300px;border:2px solid grey"
  />
</div>
<h1 class="text-2xl pb-3">Sharing Lists</h1>
To share a list, a user should click upon the list they wish to share. Upon doing
so, they should notice a share button beneath the user's name. Here's an image of
where it's located.
<div class="flex justify-center">
  <img
    src="https://muchquak.github.io/sharebutton.png"
    alt="/sharebutton.png"
    style="width:80%;height:80%;border:2px solid grey"
  />
</div>
Upon clicking the share button, user should now see a popup modal that allows them
to enter the email of the person they wish to share their list with. Here's an image
of what the sharing modal looks like.
<div class="flex justify-center">
  <img
    src="https://muchquak.github.io/addcollab.png"
    alt="/addcollab.png"
    style="width:80%;height:80%;border:2px solid grey"
  />
</div>
One just needs to simply type in the email of the person they wish to share their
list with and hit enter and they're done!

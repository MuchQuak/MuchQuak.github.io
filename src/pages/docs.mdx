<h1 class="text-2xl pb-3">Ways to Create Lists</h1>

There are various ways to create a list. <br /> <br />

<dl>
  <dt>  <b> 1. From the Search Results Page </b> </dt> <br />
  <dd>
    Upon viewing the results of a search, a user can click on the plus button on
    the upper righthand corner of a tree card. From here, a modal called "My
    Lists" should appear and the user should click on "Add to New List".
  </dd>
  <div class="flex justify-center">
    <img
      src="PlusButton-new.png"
      style="width:50%;height:50%;border:2px solid grey"
      src="https://muchquak.github.io/AddToNewList-new.png"
    style="width:60%;height:60%;border:2px solid grey"
    />

  </div>
  <br /><br/>
  <dt> <b> 2. From the "My Lists" Page </b> </dt> <br />
  <dd>
    The "My Lists" page can be navigated to by clicking on the user profile
    dropdown button in the upper right corner of the website. Then select "My
    Lists". Upon viewing this page, click on the "Create a list" green button on
    the left hand side of the screen.

<h1 class="text-2xl pb-3">Editing a List</h1>
To edit the details of a list, one should click onto the list that they wish to edit.
Upon doing so, they will notice an edit icon under their name, which is under the
list name, and next to the share button. There is also a public toggle button users
can click to make their list either public or private. Below is an image that has
the location of the edit button and the public toggle circled in blue, for those
who have trouble trying to find these buttons.
<div class="flex justify-center">
  <img
    src="https://muchquak.github.io/editLocation.png"
    alt="editLocation.png"
    style="width:80%;height:80%;border:2px solid grey"
  />
</div>
Upon clicking the edit icon, a modal popup will be brought up which will allow the
user to edit their list name, description, type of list, region their list applies
to, and keyword tags. Once user is done with their modifications, they just need
to simply click the submit button to update their changes. Another image is uploaded
down below to show users what to expect upon clicking the edit button. This popup
modal is where users can make their changes.
<div class="flex justify-center">
  <img
    src="https://muchquak.github.io/editModal.png"
    alt="editModal.png"
    style="width:300px;height:300px;border:2px solid grey"
  />
</div>
<h1 class="text-2xl pb-3">Sharing Lists</h1>
To share a list, a user should click upon the list they wish to share. Upon
doing so, they should notice a share button beneath the user's name. Here's an
image of where it's located.
<div class="flex justify-center">
  <img
    src="https://muchquak.github.io/sharebutton.png"
    alt="/sharebutton.png"
    style="width:80%;height:80%;border:2px solid grey"
  />
</div>
Upon clicking the share button, user should now see a popup modal that allows
them to enter the email of the person they wish to share their list with. Here's
an image of what the sharing modal looks like.
<div class="flex justify-center">
  <img
    src="https://muchquak.github.io/addcollab.png"
    alt="/addcollab.png"
    style="width:80%;height:80%;border:2px solid grey"
  />
</div>
One just needs to simply type in the email of the person they wish to share
their list with and hit enter and they're done!
